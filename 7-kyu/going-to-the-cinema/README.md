He can choose between system A and system B.</p><pre><code>System A : he buys a ticket (15 dollars) every timeSystem B : he buys a card (500 dollars) and a first ticket for 0.90 times the ticket price, then for each additional ticket he pays 0.90 times the price paid for the previous ticket.</code></pre><h4 id="example">Example:</h4><p>If John goes to the cinema 3 times:</p><pre><code>System A : 15 * 3 = 45System B : 500 + 15 * 0.90 + (15 * 0.90) * 0.90 + (15 * 0.90 * 0.90) * 0.90 ( = 536.5849999999999, no rounding for each ticket)</code></pre><p>John wants to know how many times he must go to the cinema so that the <em>final result</em> of System B, when rounded <em>up</em> to the next dollar, will be cheaper than System A.</p><p>The function <code>movie</code> has 3 parameters: <code>card</code> (price of the card), <code>ticket</code> (normal price of a ticket), <code>perc</code> (fraction of what he paid for the previous ticket) and returns the first <code>n</code> such that</p><pre><code>ceil(price of System B) &lt; price of System A.</code></pre><h4 id="more-examples">More examples:</h4><pre><code>movie(500, 15, 0.9) should return 43     (with card the total price is 634, with tickets 645)movie(100, 10, 0.95) should return 24     (with card the total price is 235, with tickets 240)</code></pre>
