Now time to pick up all the cr@p! :D</p><p>Given a 2D array to represent your garden, you must find and collect all of the dog cr@p - represented by <code>'@'</code>.</p><p>You will also be given the number of bags you have access to (<code>bags</code>), and the capactity of a bag (<code>cap</code>). If there are no <code>bags</code> then you can't pick anything up, so you can ignore <code>cap</code>.</p><p>You need to find out if you have enough capacity to collect all the cr@p and make your garden clean again. </p><p>If you do, return <code>'Clean'</code>, else return <code>'Cr@p'</code>.</p><p>Watch out though - if your dog is out there (<code>'D'</code>), he gets very touchy about being watched. If he is there you need to return <code>'Dog!!'</code>.</p><p>For example:</p><pre><code>bags = 2cap = 2x (or garden) =[[ _ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ ], [ _ , _ , _ , _ , @ , _ ], [ @ , _ , _ , _ , _ , _ ]]</code></pre><p>returns <code>'Clean'</code></p>
