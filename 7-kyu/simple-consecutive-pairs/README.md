Count = 2--the fourth pair is (7,6), also consecutive. Count = 3. --the last digit has no pair, so we ignore.</code></pre><p>More examples in the test cases. </p><p>Good luck!</p><p>Please also try <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b76a34ff71e5de9db0000f2" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">Simple time difference</a></p>
