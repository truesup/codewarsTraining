The values in the array will either be numbers or strings, or a mix of both. You will not get an empty array, nor a sparse one.</p><p>Your job is to return a single array that has first the numbers sorted in ascending order, followed by the strings sorted in alphabetic order. The values must maintain their original type. </p><p>Note that numbers written as strings are strings and must be sorted with the other strings.</p>
