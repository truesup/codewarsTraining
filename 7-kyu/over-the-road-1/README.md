Naturally, you would like to find out the house number of the people on the other side of the street. The street looks something like this:</p><hr><h3 id="street">Street</h3><pre><code>1|   |63|   |45|   |2  you</code></pre><p>Evens increase on the right; odds decrease on the left. House numbers start at <code>1</code> and increase without gaps.When <code>n = 3</code>, <code>1</code> is opposite <code>6</code>, <code>3</code> opposite <code>4</code>, and <code>5</code> opposite <code>2</code>. </p><hr><h3 id="example-address-n----output">Example (address, n --&gt; output)</h3><p>Given your house number <code>address</code> and length of street <code>n</code>, give the house number on the opposite side of the street.</p><pre><code>1, 3 --&gt; 63, 3 --&gt; 42, 3 --&gt; 53, 5 --&gt; 8</code></pre><h2 id="note-about-errors">Note about errors</h2><p>If you are timing out, running out of memory, or get any kind of "error", read on.Both n and address could get upto 500 billion with over 200 random tests. If you try to store the addresses of 500 billion houses in a list then you will run out of memory and the tests will crash. This is not a kata problem so please don't post an issue. Similarly if the tests don't complete within 12 seconds then you also fail. </p><p>To solve this, you need to think of a way to do the kata without making massive lists or huge for loops. Read the discourse for some inspiration :)</p>
