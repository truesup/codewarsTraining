Sure you have, but exactly how many? Maybe it's time to write a program to figure it out.</p><p>You know that a piece of paper has a thickness of <code>0.0001m</code>. Given <code>distance</code> in units of meters, calculate how many times you have to fold the paper to make the paper reach this distance.<br>(If you're not familiar with the concept of folding a paper: Each fold doubles its total thickness.)</p><p>Note: Of course you can't do half a fold. You should know what this means ;P</p><p>Also, if somebody is giving you a negative distance, it's clearly bogus and you should yell at them by returning <code>null</code> (or whatever equivalent in your language). In Shell please return <code>None</code>. In C and COBOL please return <code>-1</code>.</p>
