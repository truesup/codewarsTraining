John has a list ofthe first <code>n</code> donations: <code>[14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15]</code>He wants to know how much the next benefactor should give to the association so that the average of the first <code>n + 1</code> donations should reach an average of <code>30</code>.After doing the math he found <code>149</code>. He thinks that he could have made a mistake.</p><p>Could you help him?</p><h2 id="task">Task</h2><p>The function should return the expected donation(rounded up to the next integer) that will permit to reach the average. </p><p>Should the last donation be a non positive number <code>(&lt;= 0)</code> John wants us either to throw an error or return such value so he will clearly see that his expectations are not great enough.</p><p><em>In "Sample Tests" you can see what to return.</em></p><h3 id="notes">Notes:</h3><ul><li>all donations and new average are numbers (integers or floats), array of donations can be empty.</li><li>See examples below and "Sample Tests" to see which return is to be done.</li></ul><pre><code>array: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], new average: 92 -&gt; result: 645array: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], new average: 2  -&gt; result: variable, see "Sample Tests" </code></pre>
