Similarly, <code>a11y</code> is an abbreviation of <code>accessibility</code>.</p><p>Write a function that takes a string and turns any and all "words" (see below) within that string of <strong>length 4 or greater</strong> into an abbreviation, following these rules:</p><ul><li>A "word" is a sequence of alphabetical characters. By this definition, any other character like a space or hyphen (eg. "elephant-ride") will split up a series of letters into two words (eg. "elephant" and "ride").</li><li>The abbreviated version of the word should have the first letter, then the number of removed characters, then the last letter (eg. "elephant ride" =&gt; "e6t r2e").</li></ul><h2 id="example">Example</h2><pre><code> input: "elephant-rides are really fun!"          ^^^^^^^^*^^^^^*^^^*^^^^^^*^^^* words (^):   "elephant" "rides" "are" "really" "fun"                123456     123     1     1234     1 ignore short words:               X              X abbreviate:    "e6t"     "r3s"  "are"  "r4y"   "fun" all non-word characters (*) remain in place                     "-"      " "    " "     " "     "!"output: "e6t-r3s are r4y fun!"</code></pre>
