If not, give it a quick look to get how things work.</p><p>Well, time to expand the family a little more: think of a Quadribonacci starting with a signature of 4 elements and each following element is the sum of the 4 previous, a Pentabonacci (well <em>Cinquebonacci</em> would probably sound a bit more italian, but it would also sound really awful) with a signature of 5 elements and each following element is the sum of the 5 previous, and so on.</p><p>Well, guess what? You have to build a Xbonacci function that takes a <strong>signature</strong> of X elements <em>- and remember each next element is the sum of the last X elements -</em> and returns the first <strong>n</strong> elements of the so seeded sequence.</p><pre><code>xbonacci {1,1,1,1} 10 = {1,1,1,1,4,7,13,25,49,94}xbonacci {0,0,0,0,1} 10 = {0,0,0,0,1,1,2,4,8,16}xbonacci {1,0,0,0,0,0,1} 10 = {1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,6}xbonacci {1,1} produces the Fibonacci sequence</code></pre>
