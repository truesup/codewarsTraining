The game works like this:</p><p>You have a bunch of red and blue marbles. To start the game you grab a handful of marbles of each color and put them into the bag, keeping track of how many of each color go in. You take turns reaching into the bag, guessing a color, and then pulling one marble out. You get a point if you guessed correctly. The trick is you only have three seconds to make your guess, so you have to think quickly.</p><p>You've decided to write a function, <code>guessBlue()</code> to help automatically calculate whether you should guess "blue" or "red". The function should take four arguments:</p><ul><li>the number of blue marbles you put in the bag to start</li><li>the number of red marbles you put in the bag to start</li><li>the number of blue marbles pulled out so far (always lower than the starting number of blue marbles)</li><li>the number of red marbles pulled out so far (always lower than the starting number of red marbles)</li></ul><p><code>guessBlue()</code> should return the probability of drawing a blue marble, expressed as a float. For example, <code>guessBlue(5, 5, 2, 3)</code> should return <code>0.6</code>.</p>
