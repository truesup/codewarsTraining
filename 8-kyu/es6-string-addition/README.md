Your task is to find out what this is and write a function that will add two strings together, there must be a space between the two strings.</p><p><code>+</code> , <code>.concat()</code> &amp; <code>.join()</code> will not be allowed in this exercise. I have also removed some other methods that can be used to cheat!  </p><p>If one of the arguments is a number your code must coerce it into being a string.</p>
