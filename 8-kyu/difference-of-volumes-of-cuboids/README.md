Each list will consist of 3 positive integers above 0, representing the dimensions of cuboids <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. You must find the difference of the cuboids' volumes regardless of which is bigger.</p><p>For example, if the parameters passed are <code>([2, 2, 3], [5, 4, 1])</code>, the volume of <code>a</code> is 12 and the volume of <code>b</code> is 20. Therefore, the function should return 8.</p><p>Your function will be tested with pre-made examples as well as random ones.</p><p><strong>If you can, try writing it in one line of code.</strong></p>
