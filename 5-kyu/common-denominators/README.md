[numer_n, denom_n] ] or[ (numer_1, denom_1) , ... (numer_n, denom_n) ] </code></pre><p> where all numbers are positive ints. You have to produce a result in the form:</p><pre><code>(N_1, D) ... (N_n, D) or[ [N_1, D] ... [N_n, D] ] or[ (N_1', D) , ... (N_n, D) ] or{{N_1, D} ... {N_n, D}} or"(N_1, D) ... (N_n, D)"</code></pre><p>depending on the language (See Example tests) in which D is as small as possible and </p><pre><code>N_1/D == numer_1/denom_1 ... N_n/D == numer_n,/denom_n.</code></pre><h4 id="example">Example:</h4><pre><code>convertFracs [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)] `shouldBe` [(6, 12), (4, 12), (3, 12)]</code></pre><h4 id="note">Note:</h4><p>Due to the fact that the first translations were written long ago - more than 6 years - these first translations have only irreducible fractions. </p><p>Newer translations have some reducible fractions. To be on the safe side it is better to do a bit more work by simplifying fractions even if they don't have to be.</p><h4 id="note-for-bash">Note for Bash:</h4><p>input is a string,  e.g <code>"2,4,2,6,2,8"</code>output is then          <code>"6 12 4 12 3 12"</code></p>
