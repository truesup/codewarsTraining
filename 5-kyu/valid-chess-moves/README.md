Your task is to count the number of unique positions that knight could reach using exactly two moves.In chess a knight can move either 2 squares horizonally and 1 square vertically OR 2 squares vertically and one square horizontally. It must stay on the board at all times (8x8 squares).</p><p>The chess board will be presented as a 2D array. The knight's position is indicated by a "K" and empty squares "0"</p><pre><code>[ [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ],  [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ],  [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'K', '0', '0' ],  [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'I' ],  [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ],  [ '0', '0', 'V', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ],  [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ],  [ '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0' ] ]</code></pre><p>Make sure to return the number of unique end positions for the knight as it may be able to reach the same location via different routes. </p><p>Also bear in mind the kinght can return to its starting position. </p><p>Do not count positions the knight can reach in one move but not in two.</p><p>For example, in the above grid, the cell marked with an 'I' can be reached in one move, but a second move will take the knight away from this square, making this an invalid endpoint. </p><p>The position marked with a 'V' is an example of a valid endpoint.</p>
